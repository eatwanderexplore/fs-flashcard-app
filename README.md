# Remote Coding Flashcards

When studying a new language, a popular and effective way to retain vocabulary and syntax rules is to use spaced repetition system (SRS). 

This includes learning programming languages!

Remote Coding Bootcamp is invested in seeing each student learn and understand how to code quickly and remember lessons learned over time.
